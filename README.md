### Data science

[Car Crash Analysis](https://github.com/greg-codes/CarCrash_analysis) performs univariate time series analysis on a multi-year car crash dataset.


### Physics

Link to [my PhD dissertation](https://github.com/greg-codes/dissertation), titled "Application of Attosecond Techniques to Condensed Matter Systems".

Link to [my candidacy exam](https://github.com/greg-codes/OpticalClocks), which covered advances in lattice-based optical atomic clocks.

[Gascalc](https://github.com/greg-codes/GasCalc) contains gas flow and phase matching calculations for design gas sources for high harmonic generation.

[CXRO_calc](https://github.com/greg-codes/CXRO_calc/) uses atomic / material databases to calculate physical parameters, XUV transmission through media, Fresnel reflectivity, and aspects of high harmonic generation.
